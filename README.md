# <div align="center">Hello there! Software engineer in the making here ~</div>  

## About me
+ Hi~ Iâ€™m Aline, currently studying a full-stack development program in Incheon, Korea!
+ Previously an English teacher and a graduate from a masterâ€™s degree in Tourism Management and Hospitality.
+ I decided to take a turn in my career and take on a new challenge!
+ I find it fascinating the things we can build through coding and I think my patience and problem solving skills could be useful assets in the making of my future projects.
*Follow me to see more of my progress!*
